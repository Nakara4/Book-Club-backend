## ðŸ”§ **Key Features & Validation**

### **Automatic Field Population**
```python
def create(self, validated_data):
    validated_data['creator'] = self.context['request'].user
    book_club = super().create(validated_data)
    
    # Auto-create admin membership
    Membership.objects.create(
        user=book_club.creator,
        book_club=book_club,
        role='admin'
    )
    return book_club
```

### **Smart Validation Examples**
```python
def validate_name(self, value):
    """Ensure book club name is unique for the user"""
    user = self.context['request'].user
    if BookClub.objects.filter(name=value, creator=user).exists():
        raise serializers.ValidationError("You already have a book club with this name.")
    return value

def validate_max_members(self, value):
    """Ensure max_members is reasonable"""
    if value < 2:
        raise serializers.ValidationError("A book club must allow at least 2 members.")
    if value > 1000:
        raise serializers.ValidationError("Maximum members cannot exceed 1000.")
    return value
```

### **Context-Aware SerializerMethodFields**
```python
def get_can_join(self, obj):
    """Check if current user can join this club"""
    request = self.context.get('request')
    if not request or not request.user.is_authenticated:
        return False
    
    # Multiple validation checks...
